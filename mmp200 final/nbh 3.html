    <h1>Welcome to SunsetPark</h1>
    <p>
      In the 1950s, there were 1,820 Puerto Ricans living in Sunset Park; by 1970, this number had grown to nearly 24,000.  As with all new groups coming to Sunset Park, they settled along the waterfront, in residences vacated by their escalating predecessors. where they took up jobs in the industrials center of the neighborhood.  Puerto Ricans at first mainly lived along 3rd Avenue, which had been neglected since the construction of the Gowanus Expressway had ruined the commerce along the avenue.  As they settled in and became a larger proportion of the population, Puerto Ricans formed various social clubs–such as Moca, Hatillo, and Camuy–based on the town from which they had migrated; also, in 1966 the United Puerto Rican Organization of Sunset Park was formed to help citizens in the community.

Sunset Park’s status as a now-diminished Scandinavian neighborhood, and its more recent status as a Chinese neighborhood are more publicized, but the area has also been heavily Latinx for several decades especially the further west you go. Not mentioned very much is a Mexican pocket centered along 7th Avenue in the mid-40s, with storefronts featuring the Mexican flag colors. The storefront at right refers to Our Lady of Guadalupe, a vision of Mary that appeared to a Mexican Indian near what became Mexico City in 1521.

Although, as mentioned in the beginning of times (and continues to do) Sunset Park fosters a big community of Puerto Ricans, for the remainder of the Latinx community, there exists a difficulty in counting.  The Census does not report specifically on population groups for counts under 100 persons.  It is known, however, that Sunset Park is home to immigrants from Ecuador, Columbia, Peru, El Salvador, Venezuela, Guatemala and Nicaragua.  In fact, by a 1990 count, almost 5% of the Hispanics in Sunset Park were Ecuadorian.
Along 5th Avenue lies a myriad of stores, restaurants, groceries and pharmacies to serve either one or a variety of the various Latinx groups.  There are nearly two bodegas on every corner, with many advertising the types of specialty products they carry. Interspersed among the bodegas are a number of pharmacies, as well, each serving its own small portion of regulars.
Beginning a block above the park itself is a barrage of restaurants that amounts to a veritable tour of Latin America.  Just toss a dart at Central or South America, and Sunset Park will have somewhere for you to sample the cuisine.  There’s Columbian, Dominican, Ecuadorian, at least one El Salvadorean eatery and, of course, a plethora of Mexican restaurants.  
However, several new building initiatives are worth keeping a cautionary eye on. The fashion district is making a push to move some of its Garment District businesses into the area, according to The New York Times. A multimillion-dollar real estate project promising to make the waterfront Industry City complex the “next Soho” has also made headlines, and nightlife pop-ups in those waterfront warehouses have drawn the likes of Alexander Wang and Rihanna,  The Times also reported. 

Per a recent real estate report, the area is poised to incur a record-high rent spike, brought about by the very development that has most recently brought the greatest number of jobs (around 6,000 since 2013). Reason why this neighborhood has been experiencing a high presence of gentrification. Therefore, landlords have been increasing the rent rates to the point that some Latinx families have already been displayed out of their houses. Still, for the time being, the neighborhood remains a place that people come to for living, above all, and one where the rent isn’t too high for newcomers to start a life.

Now, crucially, Sunset Park has become a hearth and home to activism and resistance against anti-immigrant sentiment. A Facebook group, Love Trumps Hate Sunset Park Brooklyn, started by local resident Shanna Castillo, sees its members hosting potluck dinners for undocumented immigrants in the neighborhood, The New York Times reported. Since November 2016, the group has gathered the neighborhood together with a focus on human rights as much as on diverse cuisine. Lawyers and community advocates also attend, offering attendees assistance and information, and childcare is offered so that parents can relax.

  The immigrant experience is the heart and soul of the neighborhood, now more than ever, in cause and in effect. I think of the first ferries of produce to and from Manhattan as I wait for the Sunset Park Greenmarket to return. The best thing about visiting the market, even better than the produce, is seeing the flamenco dancers. The best thing about visiting Sunset Park is even better than its history alone: the most important pieces of its history are still alive and shaping its present, while newcomers who still need or want a life here are welcomed in.
